#Basic form of HTML
---
the repository i have made above is all about HTML form tag
in the above projects i have used the '<form>' tag and created the form with the help of it.
##The information is must be filled in as follows:##
-Full name
-email
-password
-date
-time
**Its preety easy to use**
###following is the code of how to add a name box in form tag###
'''<form>
<label for="inputfullname">Enter full Name:</label>
<input type="text" id="inputfullname"/>
</form>'''

has the name we will enter was in a **text** form so type="text" we added but if we wanna 
add **passowrd** the type will be type="password" and if we wanna add **email** the type will be type="email"and if wanna add **Date and Time** it will be type="date" type="time"
