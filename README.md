the repository i have made above is all about HTML `form` tag

The information is must be filled in as follows:··
1.Full name
2.email
3.password
4.date
5.time
Its preety easy to use
following is the code of how to add a name box in form tag··
```HTML
<form>
<label for="inputfullname">Enter full Name:</label>
<input type="text" id="inputfullname"/>
</form>

the name we  enter was in a text form so type="text" was added but if we wanna 
add passowrd the type will be type="password" and if we wanna add email the type will be type="email"and if wanna add Date and Time it will be type="date" type="time"
## THE CODE FOR PASSWORD IS AS:

<label for="inputfullname">Enter full Name:</label>
<input type="text" id="inputfullname"/>
</form>
